Recently I needed to compare two dates with one another to see which was greater than, less than, etc.\n\nIn my particular use case, I was using a date-picker that was returning a string like `01/28/2020`. I needed to see if this date was `>=` to the current day.\n\nThe first thing I needed to do was convert this string into a JavaScript Date Object.\n\n```js\nconst date: new Date(\"01/28/2020\");\nconsole.log(date);\n// Tue Jan 28 2020 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)\n```\n\nThen, compare this date with the current day:\n\n```js\nconst compareDate = new Date(\"01/28/2020\");\nconst today = new Date();\nconsole.log(compareDate >= today);\n// false\n```\n\nThe issue is that even though the dates are the same, the times are not.\n\n```js\nconst compareDate = new Date(\"01/28/2020\");\nconst today = new Date();\nconsole.log(\"compareDate: \", compareDate);\nconsole.log(\"today: \", today);\n// compareDate:  Tue Jan 28 2020 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)\n// today:  Tue Jan 28 2020 21:33:27 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)\n```\n\nNotice how `compareDate` has all zero's for time. The difference in time is the reason why this comparison fails. To fix this, we need to create the current day without time. We do this by instantiating a new JS Date object by individually passing in the year, month and day.\n\n```js\nconst todayWithoutTime = new Date(\n  new Date().getFullYear(),\n  new Date().getMonth(),\n  new Date().getDate()\n);\nconsole.log(\"todayWithoutTime: \", todayWithoutTime);\n// todayWithoutTime:  Tue Jan 28 2020 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)\n```\n\nSo let's try our comparison again.\n\n```js\nconst compareDate = new Date(\"01/28/2020\");\nconst todayWithoutTime = new Date(\n  new Date().getFullYear(),\n  new Date().getMonth(),\n  new Date().getDate()\n);\nconsole.log(compareDate >= todayWithoutTime);\n// true\n```\n\nThat's it. Just remember that when comparing dates in JavaScript it is vital to factor in the time. ðŸ˜Ž\n"}]
